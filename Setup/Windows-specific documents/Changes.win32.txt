Win32 - 06.January.2001, build 142
  - BasiliskII.exe is now the assembly optimized version and should work on all
    Windows versions. BasiliskII_old.exe is the unoptimized version provided for
    testing purposes. Thanks to Gwenolé Beauchesne for his suggestions.
  - Fix: the assembler version of MOVE (Ax)++,(Ay)++ [code 20d8] was faulty.
    Thanks to Akihiko Matsuo for providing this fix.
  - Fix: NUMLOCK keyboard code didn't have the extended flag set, again thanks to
    Akihiko Matsuo. For this change to take effect, you need to delete your old
    "BasiliskII_keyboard" keyboard file.
  - Fix: the NAT/Router did not always send other (non-TCP/IP) ARP requests to the NIC.
  - Fix: some other minor NAT issues.
  - Fix: Basilisk II may have crashed when a video mode was selected that was larger
    than the current Windows mode.
  - Fix: a video tilt problem when switching from GDI mode to full screen mode
    ("equal_scanline_lengths" was uninitialized if started in GDI mode).
  - An option to disable Windows screen saver while B2 is running. GUI "Misc" page.
  - An option to change the keyboard layout code. GUI "Keyboard" page.
  - Updated "NAT-Router FAQ.html" and "Tech.win32.txt".


Win32 - 26.December.2000, build 141
  - An option to use Windows Internet connection. GUI "Router" page.
    See the included document "NAT-Router FAQ.html" for details.
  - Fixed a problem in ejecting (zip) removable media under Win9x.
  - An option to enable/disable alt-enter (GUI keyboard page).
  - Energy saving modes. In GUI "Misc" page.
  - GUI window made a bit smaller so that fits onto a smaller screen
    ( exactly how small depends on the small/large Windows system font and the video card drivers ).
  - WinMe ethernet INF script fix, thanks to Mike Allison.
  - Reverted back to the old timer.cpp code.
  - More compatible timer code activated.


Win32 - 15.July.2000, build 135 (INTERNAL)
  - Win2k ethernet driver now works for users with no administrator rights.
    However, it may be necessary to run Basilisk II once with admin right
    after installing the ethernet packet driver.
  - Prevented Windows from beeping with some Alt key combinations.
  - An attempt to better tolerate faulty ASPI drivers.
  - Fixed a bug in FPU FTAN opcode (didn't pop the value 1.0 that x86 partial
    tangent FPTAN always pushes to stack for 8087/287 compatibility).
  - One optimization bug fix.
  - MMU32bit initialization fix.
  - GUI memory page: displays some more ROM file info.


Win32 - 18.June.2000, build 130
  - Workaround for one compiler bug.
  - Updated timer.cpp code.


Win32 - 09.June.2000, build 127
  - Fixed some DirectX problems (palette corruptions and freezes when switching
    between full screen and windowed modes).
  - Fixed a bug that caused a crash on restart if audio was enabled.
  - New audio synchronization code.
  - Fixed a bug in the NT version causing Corel WordPerfect 3.5 "File/Save As" crashing.
  - Fixed a bug in the NT version causing QuickTime 4 hanging.
  - Removed the obsolete NT "palette hack" option.


Win32 - 01.June.2000, build 126
  - Fixed one regression in the NT version causing Now Utilities freezing.
  - Some more FPU improvements & fixes.


Win32 - 30.May.2000, build 125
  - New "SMP" GUI page to define thread affinity masks. An affinity mask determines
    on which CPU's a process or a thread is allowed to run on a system equiped with
    multiple CPUs. If you have any speed/stability problems on a SMP system, you
    may want to adjust these settings. Windows 9x supports only one CPU.
  - FPU normalization code was accidentally left out, causing the scroll bars
    not working under MacOS 8.x with certain ROMs (thanks, Sérgio).
  - Minor fixes in FPU rounding mode handling.
  - Minor improvements in FPU quotient byte handling.


Win32 - 28.May.2000, build 124
  - Rewritten the FPU, now uses 10-byte (64-bit mantissa) floating point code,
    partially in assembly. I'm not aware of any significant FPU bugs anymore.
  - The FPU is now enabled by default, since it seems to be working fine.
  - "Get hardware volume" (for audio beeps) is now enabled by default.
  - More than a hundred (most frequently used) CPU opcodes written in assembly
    (NT/Win2k version only). Optimized for CPUs PII or better.
  - Fixed a trace flag bug that caused CodeWarrior single-stepping not working.
  - Fixed a bug in long division remainder sign bit handling. The bug caused some
    DateTimeUtils functions to fail.
  - A new system menu command to temporarily remove the ROM write protection.
    NT version only (I don't expect this to be useful to anybody else but me)
  - Just for fun: startup sound for those 1MB ROMs that have the sound embedded
    in uncompressed form. Enabled by default (if audio is enabled), can be disabled
    in GUI audio page. Saves the sound in a file named as "startup_XXXXXXXX.wav",
    where XXXXXXXX is the ROM file checksum. This allows you to replace the sound file.
    Please don't send any bug reports related to startup sounds.
  - An attempt to make the cursor less jumpy when using the alternate
    mouse emulation mode.
  - Some new "undocumented" options:
      Disable maximize gadget:
        BasiliskII.ini [GUI] Disable Maximize=1
      Run multiple copies of BasiliskII simultaneously:
        BasiliskII.ini [Debug] allow_multiple_instances=1
  - Removed some unused code.
  - There is a problem in handling file names longer than 31 characters with the
    external file system (My Computer). Shorten the file names if you have to.


Win32 - 24.April.2000, build 122
  - Reorganized code to reduce the performance hit introduced by the new 60Hz code.
  - Scrap manager A-line traps hooked.
  - The checked status of the new system menu commands was not updated correctly.
  - The crash recovery code was not enabled.
  - A mechanism to shut down properly the one-second interrupt thread.


Win32 - 23.April.2000, build 121
  - Implemented clipboard text transfer Host -> Mac.
  - Fix by Toshimitsu Tanaka: Kanji character set was incorrect in Mac -> Host
    clipboard text translation.
  - Implemented 15, 16, 24 and 32 bit GDI screen modes for the NT version.
  - Some miscellaneous screen draw optimizations.
  - Fixed one DirectX full screen video corruption problem.
  - Parameter RAM saved to a different file for each ROM checksum.
  - More controlled shutdown when the application crashes.
  - Possibility to save changes to undoable volumes before a crash.
  - New mount mode: similar to "undoable", but saves changes without asking
    questions if the system was shut down properly.
  - Fixed: the "undoable" commit prompt window was sometimes
    hidden behind the Basilisk II main window.
  - Fixed: in GUI disk page, when moving items up or down, the mount mode was lost.
  - Multi-block i/o for undo file.
  - Increased the undo_buffer hash table size from 1024 to 4096.
  - Fixed: an id conflict in SCSI GUI dialog.
  - New GUI mouse page option: "Normal ADB mouse emulation" v.s.
    "More complete ADB mouse emulation". The latter is to be used with games
    accessing the mouse with low level ADB calls (e.g. Apeiron, Marathon).
  - Some new system menu commands.


Win32 - 3.April.2000, build 119
  - Fixed a memory bank problem in Win9x version. It caused most of
    the 512 KB ROMs not working properly.


Win32 - 2.April.2000, build 118
  - Two new volume file mount modes: "virtual read/write" and "undoable".
    See the GUI disk page.
  - Fixed a problem in switching between full screen mode and windowed mode.
  - Sorted the GUI video mode list.
  - Win9x GUI ethernet page: PPPMac removed.
  - Fixed a bug that caused multiple about box items in the system menu.


Win32 - 12.March.2000, build 116
  - GUI keyboard page: Reserve Alt-Space for MacOS (NT)


Win32 - 12.March.2000, build 115
  - Ethernet driver for Windows 2000 professional. See Ethernet.win32.txt for details.
  - Now remembers last 4 sent ethernet packets (instead of 1) for echo detection.
    This may or may not cure some AppleTalk related networking problems.
    If you want to experiment with a different echo buffer size, change
    MAX_ECHO in ether_windows.cpp.
  - Workaround for one NT4 bug which caused the ethernet adapter sometimes
    be unavailable after relaunching BasiliskII or the GUI.
  - Integrated Gwenolé Beauchesne's faster memory bank method to the
    Windows 9x compatible version.	
  - Multiply and division written in assembly for minor speed boost in integer
    arithmetics. The exception handler takes care of division overflow and
    division by zero checking.
  - Increased the reported free space of My Computer from 64MB to 1GB.
    This helps in copying large files from Mac to the host.
  - Fixed a bug in NT audio CD support: sub-Q channel i/o control request didn't
    initialize the format code, causing reading of the audio cd position
    information to fail.
  - Fixed a bug that caused the error message "Failed to initialize video." under Win2k
    if the "Disable Windows 98 screen optimizations" was not checked.
  - Two more "undocumented" BasiliskII.ini settings:
      [Debug] allow_all_rom_sizes=0 or 1
      [Debug] disable_internal_wait=0 or 1
  - Inlined HasMacStarted() and TriggerInterrupt().
  - BlockMove() replacement return value & flags were missing.
  - timer.cpp: minor optimizations.
  - setup_frame(), fake_cpufunctbl_all_funcs(), m68k_run_1():
    jump through the indirect op code table instead of the real table.
  - New media check hotkeys:
      Shift-Ctrl-F8: remount all floppies (including Zip disks)
      Shift-Ctrl-F9: remount all CD's
      Shift-Ctrl-F10: remount all hard disk partitions
    Shift-Ctrl-F11 works as before; mounts all floppies and CD's.  
  - Implemented fixed SCSI target id's.
  - Changed the default priority of the 1Hz thread to be "above normal".
  - Removed an unnecessary delay when entering the GUI SCSI page
    (allocated optimal sized ASPI buffer; the GUI does not need it).
  - Fixed keyboard codes "Numpad Enter" and "Numpad Divide". If you have
    customized keyboard, you may need to delete the file "BasiliskII_keyboard"
    for this fix to take effect, or at least save the keyboard layout once.
  - Note for those having problems with GetROM utility: remember to boot your
    Mac with extensions off before attempting to dump the ROM image.
  - Updated documentation.
  - Added minimize button.
  - Added maximize button (switches to full-screen mode).
  - Added system menu.
  - Added about box to system menu.
  - Added icon.
  - Possibility to set video adapter vertical refresh rate (for DirectX full-screen
    mode and NT linear frame buffer mode). In general, it's better to set the refresh
    rates in the display control panel. Unfortunately not all adapters allow this;
    that's the reason for this feature.
    If the refresh rate is invalid, monitor default setting is used instead.
    Under NT4, the DirectX 5 hack is needed, or a rather new service pack is required.
    Which one is the minimum -- I don't really know. Works with sp5 for me.
  - Version number set to 0.8.
  - Customized "My Computer" name was read from an incorrect registry key under Win2k.
  - Removes trailing white space from preference entries (there were problems when
    copying/pasting a preference file from a web page).
  - $Null devices (floppy, CD-ROM) not supported any more.
  - Printer/Modem port FILE output paths can be customized.
  - Support for multiple preference files. General page in GUI.


Win32 - 4.December.1999, build 102
  - Frank M. Siegert fixed a bug in b2ether.vxd that caused Windows 9x
    hang on shutdown.
  - Attempted to fix various regressions introduced by the build 100.
  - Fixed a bug that caused ExtFS to show only partially the contents
    of a folder if there was special characters in some file names.


Win32 - 27.November.1999, build 101
  - Fixed a bug that caused colors to be incorrect in the Win9x compatible
    version (color depths 15,16,24 and 32). Note that these color depths
    are still incorrect in the NT version when using GDI mode; this is a
    completely different problem, just happens to look similar.


Win32 - 27.November.1999, build 100
  - MacOS 8.x Finder copy bug fixed by Christian's new memory management code.
  - Introducing Christian's latest and greatest achievement, the ExtFS file system:
    - Enabled and configured in "My Computer" GUI page. Disabled by default in
      this initial release, will be enabled by default in subsequent builds.
    - Installs a "My Computer" (or whatever you have named it in Windows) icon on
      the desktop, with transparent access to your drives.
    - This is a much safer way to manipulate files than any other option.
      Even in the worst case, only the accessed file may get corrupted (I haven't
      seen even that so far).
    - A virtual Desktop folder is created in the folder where you have the
      Basilisk II executable file.
    - Virtual desktop folder is currently always in the same folder where the
      Basilisk II executable file is -- not in the working directory.
    - "Trash"ing files from other drives than where the "Desktop" is located 
      is currently slow, due to the copying to the "Virtual Desktop\Trash".
      This is probably going to change some time in future.
    - Creates folders ".finf" and ".rsrc" in each accessed directory. ".finf"
      contains Finder information of the files, ".rsrc" contains resource forks.
    - Note that since all your drives are within one big "virtual drive",
      Finder defaults to moving (instead of copying) when you drag&drop
      items between real drives. Use option key to force a copy operation.
    - Customizable file type/creator mappings, compatible with HFVExplorer.
    - Listing contents of very large directories may be slow, because MakeFSSpec
      trap word is not implemented.
    - Known bugs: some documents may not open from ExtFS (for example, CodeWarrior
      crashes when opening a file, Disk Copy refuses to mount images).
      The reported free space is not correct.
      With some 512k ROM's, the ExtFS may not work in 68020 mode.
      Use 68040 mode for best results.
      Applications seem to launch fine. Copying and moving files has no known bugs.
  - Minor optimizations in screen drawing (1,2,4,24 bit depths)
  - Read-only hfv files can now be shared between networked B2 workstations.
  - An attempt to fix floppy installation problems thanks to Christian
    now doing sony periodic actions during interrupt time, instead of relying
    applications co-operatively calling SystemTask().
  - New periodic action code moved from 60Hz interrupt to (a new) 1Hz interrupt
    for better performance.
  - All removable media (Zip etc) moved to floppy page of the GUI.
    You should remove them from the Disk tab and reinstall in Floppy tab.
  - 68040 emulation. Combined Christian's 68040 code with my modest efforts.
    No MMU, otherwise rather complete.
  - Default cpu changed to 68040 (first-time installation) as it seems to
    work rather well.
  - Optimized interrupt code.
  - "Disable low memory caching" option moved from Experiment page to Misc page.
    It seems worthwhile to keep this option as it sometimes speeds up OS 8.
  - Experiment page removed.
  - Fixed clock time zone error (thanks to Toshimitsu Tanaka).
  - Wheel mouse delay changed from 40ms to 20ms.
  - CPU prefetch code disabled. Dropped UAE 68000 "more compatible" code.
  - Added some more sanity checks for audio parameter initialization.
  - Alt-enter (toggle window <-> full screen) works now in windowed Direct X mode.
  - For those having trouble with alert sounds: enable "Get hardware volume"
    in audio page. Be aware of that this may break some QuickTime
    applications under System 7.x (notably Myst). Maybe something else too,
    please keep this in mind if you suddenly have unexpected problems.
  - Minor cosmetic changes (GUI keyboard layout dialog etc).

  - A version of Basilisk II that runs only under Windows NT:
    - Faster. Uses direct memory access (no memory banks).
    - EA code rewritten for speed.
    - Somewhat less stable than the generic version, meaning that a buggy Mac application
      may crash this version, while the generic version would only drop to Finder.
      Most of the crashes seems to be fixed now.
    - In GDI mode high color depths (15,16,24,32) display colors incorrectly.
      Direct X modes support all color depths.
    - The frame buffer and the ROM are shamelessly relocated to different addresses to
      adapt to the virtual address space limitations of different WinOS flavors. This may
      cause problems with older ROMs (although I haven't seen this happening).
    - In future, all new builds are going to use this code base, because
      it lays foundation of using the DR (dynamic recompilation) technology.
    - DR code is disabled and not yet included in the source archive (because it's
      not yet useable to anybody).
    - The GUI always launches the program "BasiliskII.exe". If you decide that
      you wish to keep using this NT version, rename the file "BasiliskIINT.exe"
      to be "BasiliskII.exe".


Win32 V0.7 (alpha) - 3.October.1999, build 94
  - Fixed an error when switching from full screen mode to windowed mode
    under classic emulation (the contents of the Mac window was displaced).
  - Edited the "mount partition as read/write" warning dialog texts.
  - Removed the message "The floppy was ejected ...".
  - Many cd, floppy and other removable media access fixes. Mostly for Windows NT,
    but some of them apply to Win9x too.
  - To access Mac formatted Zip media under NT, mount the drive as a PHYSICALDRIVE.
  - To access PC Zip partitions under NT, mount Zip as <letter>:
  - Do not mount Zip media both as PHYSICALDRIVE and drive letter.
  - To boot from a Zip under NT, mount as a PHYSICALDRIVE and move it to top
    in the "installed disks" list.
  - Hard disk PHYSICALDRIVEs are always read only, partitions can be mounted
    as read/write.
  - Possibility to mount removable media read-only.
  - Another FPU bug fixed: the value of the quotient byte was not calculated
    correctly. Thanks to Marciano Siniscalchi, Jim Watters and Dan for
    their help in finding this bug.
  - Fixed a bug in EtherReset(). The installed protocol list was not cleared.
    This bug caused crashes on restart when ethernet was enabled.
  - Fixed an ethernet bug in adding/removing multicast addresses. This bug *may*
    have caused the messages "Your AppleTalk connection was interrupted", resulting
    the zone information to be lost.
  - PacketAddMulticast() and PacketDelMulticast() always report success because
    some NICs report ok status when the given multicast address is already defined,
    but other report a failure.
  - Fixed an ethernet bug in removing attached protocol. Thanks to Peter Lambert
    for his bug reports which helped in finding ethernet bugs.
  - Automatic selection of correct 15/16 bit screen color mode.
  - Support for low color modes (1, 2 and 4 bits). The 2 bit mode works
    properly only in DX full screen.
  - 24 bit Direct X full screen mode (for most screen cards). Colors may be wrong
    with some video adapter pixel formats. Somewhat slower than the 32 bit full
    screen mode.
  - Inlined set/get interrupt flag functions for smaller latency times.
  - Mouse wheel support under Windows 95. Not tested, I don't have IntelliMouse
    drivers. Please let me know whether it works or not.
  - Changed the default priority of the ethernet threads to "normal".
  - Changed the default value of "nosoundwheninactive" to "true".
  - New "Experiment" page in the GUI. The first experiment is to disable
    caching of the lowest 64kB of Mac RAM. How does this affect the performance?
    Try it with a single Mac application, and with many apps running.
  - An option to automatically restart the GUI after Basilisk II is terminated.
    See the "Misc" page.
  - Removed the unusable "PPPMAC" entries from Win9x ethernet page.
  - "Disable Windows 98 screen optimizations" did not always work, fixed.
  - Minor optimization in classic emulation Direct X screen code.
  - Minor optimization in exception handler.
  - Minor optimization in screen drawing.
  - Always allows media removal on exit under NT. (If the CD was not ejected
    in Basilisk II, it sometimes could not be ejected in Windows).
    This bug was fixed in build 92 but was left undocumented.


Win32 V0.7 (alpha) - 19.September.1999, build 92
  - Some Direct X fixes.
  - Some speed optimizations.
  - One more FPU bug fixed, some still remain.
  - A new attempt to write accurate 60Hz timer. *May* cause problems on
    low-end machines. If it does, disable it in the GUI "Debug" page.
  - Mouse wheel support:
    The wheel can be used to send either line up/line down or
    page up/page down character sequences.
    Wheel click can be used to either toggle between vertical and horizontal
    scrolling, to send a "Command - Left Arrow" combination, or a user-defined
    character sequence. "Command - Left Arrow" equals to the "Back" button in 
    Netscape an IE 4. Tested under NT 4.0 and Windows 98. Doesn't work under
    Windows 95. See the GUI "Mouse" page.
  - The GUI "Keyboard+Mouse" page was split to two separate pages.
  - Possibility to mount hard disk partitions/hard disks read/write.
    See the GUI "Disk" page. Use *ONLY* if you know what you're doing.
    Do *not* use the "SCSI" page to mount volumes accessible in Windows. 
  - Possibility to mount HFV volume files read-only.
  - Windowed GDI mode now uses whatever color depth the user has chosen.
    Previously it always forced the Windows Control Panel value (except
    when selecting between 15/16 bit modes), yielding low performance.
    So if you run the Mac in 256 colors using the GDI mode, and still
    want to use high color mode in Windows, you will have a big speed win.
    Windowed Direct X mode works the old way (forces the control panel setting)
    and therefore may be actually slower than the GDI mode in some cases.
  - Classic emulation works to some extent. Tested only minimally.
    System 7.5.5 didn't boot in my test, 6.0.8 did. The window is always 512x342
    pixels, either windowed GDI mode or full screen Direct X 640x480 mode.
  - Removed the words "[slow mode]" from the caption when B2 is inactive.
  - Alt-Enter toggles between windowed GDI screen mode and full-screen 
    Direct X mode, has no effect if other modes are used. 
    ( Hint: if B2 crashes in Direct X full screen mode, it's a good idea try to
    switch back to the GDI mode before killing the application.)
  - Under NT, it is possible to define whether the following key combinations
    are trapped by Windows or MacOS: Control-escape, Alt-escape, Alt-tab.
    Previously they were always trapped by MacOS. In the spirit of making
    everything possible configurable, you can now change this behaviour in
    the Keyboard GUI tab.


Win32 V0.7 (alpha) - 1.August.1999, build 90
  - Serial: kSERDInputBuffer implemented (MacOS can define the size of the
    serial port input buffer)
  - Fixed an internal timer bug introduced by build 89.
  - Serial: possible eternal loop in KillIO fixed
  - Changed to use more accurate timing. This may (or then again, maybe not)
    cause problems for non-intel cpu's. If it does, Basilisk II will detect
    this and refuse to run with an error message "Your hardware does not support
    high resolution timers". Let me know if this happens.
  - Reminder: use the FPU only if you must. The remaining bugs may still
    sometimes hang.


Win32 V0.7 (alpha) - 31.July.1999, build 89
  - Audio muting now works.
  - Fixed a bug that caused the volume control slider jump around.
    Note that it still may jump by a very small amount because the volume
    levels are converted to Windows values and back to Mac values again.
    This is needed to keep the volume controls in Windows and Mac in sync.
  - Alert sounds still don't work. Personally I find the alert sounds very
    annoying anyway, so don't expect them to be fixed any time soon.
  - Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the sound thread not terminating properly
    when shutting down Basilisk II.
  - Some minor audio thread performance optimizations.
  - The GUI memory page shows some ROM file info.
  - If Direct X fails to initialize, a more specific error messages is given.
  - Now 68030 mode works with some more 1 MB ROMs without FPU (not all of them though).


Win32 V0.7 (alpha) - 27.July.1999, build 87
  - Sound & volume control. Check the "Audio" GUI page and Mac "Sound"
    control panel. Mute does not work correctly.
  - CPU type selection 68020/68030. Use 68030 + 32bit clean 512kB ROM if you
    need OpenTransport. Remember that some ROM's only boot with FPU enabled.
    Otherwise use 68020 since some applications may crash when using 68030 setting.
  - An option to automatically disable sound when Basilisk II is inactive.
  - Option "noaudio" renamed to be "nosound".
  - Priority settings for the audio thread.
  - Fixed bugs in the FPU. Most software (but not all) should work with it now.
    The following floating point instructions had bugs: 
      FINT, FINTRZ, FGETEXP, FMOD, FREM, FSCALE, FMOVEM list handling,
      FSINCOS, FMOVECR, FMOVE, FDBcc, FMOVEM Control Registers An,
      Condition code "Not Greater Than or Equal".
  - The FPU is still disabled by default because some bugs remain.
  - FPU conversion routines rewritten for speed.
  - Some FPU commands rewritten for speed.
  - FPU conversion routines now handle NaN and infinity better.
  - 80 bit assembler FPU code (currently disabled).
  - Try to enable the FPU for more web browsing speed (but remember that some
    applications may still work incorrectly). Netscape 4.0.x seems to work,
    but 3.0.4 may be the safest choice.
  - "Create new HFV file" GUI command now zeroes the first megabyte
    to prevent the possibility of "ghost" partitions.
  - Default priority values for serial port threads dropped to "Normal".
  - Ethernet now works under NT when logged in as a normal user
    without administrator rights.
  - Timer code fixes.               
  - Some other minor fixes.
  - The source code archive now contains pre-generated UAE files, you
    don't have to run gencpu & build68k unless you change them. Building
    the project is therefore very easy; so you don't have any excuse to not
    contribute anymore ;) Seriously, there has been no source code
    contributions to the Windows port so far. What a shame.


Win32 V0.6 (alpha) - 8.July.1999, build 81
  - Fixed a problem in shutting down Linear Frame Buffer mode, sometimes
    was hung in a black screen.
  - Fixed a problem with custom keyboard codes. They were not always used
    if full path name was not specified for the keyboard file name.
  - Attempt to fix the daylight saving time bug (clock off by one hour)
  - Some 8 bit palette fixes. The option "NT Direct X palette hack" is probably not
    needed any more. Windowed 8 bit Direct X mode still has a palette problem.
  - New optimizations: 64 bit integer multiply/division and HAVE_GET_WORD_UNSWAPPED,
    yielding a minor (maybe 10%-15%) performance boost.
  - GUI SCSI page: Added a confirmation dialog when adding a SCSI hard disk.
  - Removed some unnecessary delays when starting up and shutting down.


Win32 V0.6 (alpha) - 5.July.1999, build 79
  - Switched compiler from VC5 to VC6
  - Merged v0.6 changes: clock fix, Classic emulation, etc, but
    Classic emulation does not work yet in Windows port.
  - Another attempt to fix the shutdown crash (build 78 fix was no good).
  - Fixed a bug that caused Win9x not to shut down properly if there were
    pending ethernet packets.
  - Fixed a crash when ROM file was not found.
  - Other miscellaneous fixes.
  - Adjusted first installation default settings.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 1.July.1999, build 78
  - Fixed two problems ín ethernet code that could often cause
    a hang or a crash.
  - Fixed a couple of shutdown issues.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 27.June.1999 (B), build 76
  - Fixed a problem accessing ethernet page when an adapter was
    not yet properly installed.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 27.June.1999, build 75
  - New GUI option (keyboard/mouse page): sticky menu bar clicks (OS8 style)
    The main menu bar is kept open even after the mouse button is released,
    under all OS versions (of course OS 8 has this feature already).
    Enabled by default. There are extensions to do the same thing, but it's
    faster to handle this in native code.
  - Bug fix: windowed mode mouse was not captured.
  - Bug fix: switching desktop (with shift-control-F11 in LFB or DX full screen mode)
    did not always restore pixel format.
  - Alt keys are not trapped any more if Basilisk II window is not active.
  - GDI specific screen code optimizations.
  - Ethernet driver for WinNT (b2ether.sys). Consult to the document
    "Ethernet.win32.txt" for details.  Please read it carefully, it contains
    important information on the usage of the ethernet networking on B2.
  - Ethernet driver for Windows 98 (b2ether.vxd). Tested also under
    Windows 95 OSR2. See "Ethernet.win32.txt" for details.
  - A simple tool program to dump Macintosh ROM to a file.
  - Changed parameter RAM timeout from one minute to 10 seconds.
  - Adjusted default parameter RAM thread priority to normal.
  - Attempted to fix a potential overflow in the screen draw code.
    This fix may have a side-effect causing a white border at the bottom
    of the screen when using some screen size/color depth combinations.
  - An option to disable Windows 98 specific video optimizations.
  - An option to connect printer port to a file (the file name is hardcoded to be 
    C:\B2TEMP.OUT, because this is just a test). You still need a printer driver
    that does not try to read from the device, or at least tolerates the read errors.
  - Started technical documentation (Tech.win32.txt). At this time, there are
    only short build instructions.
  - A new option to use real mode CD drivers under Windows 9x. Requires
    libraries B2WIN16.DLL and B2WIN32.DLL in the Basilisk II directory.
    CDEnable.vxd must be installed in \Windows\System directory.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 15.June.1999, build 70
  - Fixed a bug that overwrote the cursor area.
    (threre was sometimes a white or black rectangle following the cursor).
  - Makes somewhat better use of video card local memory. For example,
    if you could previously run a maximum of 1152x864 DirectX mode, you
    should now be able to reach 1280x1024 mode, etc.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 14.June.1999, build 69
  - Debug page. Options to log some troubleshooting data to a text file.
    Do NOT send me any files without asking first.
  - Some more entries in the Mac model name list.
  - GUI general page: new bootdriver options (boot from cd-rom).
  - Audio page. Audio is not yet implemented, but there is now
    an option whether to enable Christian's new "null" audio component
    or not. It is disabled by default. Enabling it may help you to make
    some programs run, while some others may stop running. You need
    to experiment.
  - Audio page: disable sound instructions for first-time users.
  - SCSI dialog used ' ' as a separator. Now uses '|'. This fixes a problem
    in handling vendor names with space characters.
  - SCSI fixes & improvements:
      - Splits 6 byte read/write cdb's if too big for ASPI. (Did this already for 10 byte cdb's.
      - If write6 or read6 commands fail, tries to use 10 byte commands. Some emulated
        IDE drivers support 10 byte versions only.
      - Ditto for the mode sense and mode select commands.
      - The splitting function used to determine the device block size on fly
        which is unreliable. Now queries the real value from the device.
      - Autosense implemented.
      - There can now be 7 SCSI devices instead of 6.
  - "disablescsi" command is not supported any more. Use the new commands "scsi0",
    "scsi1", ..., "scsi6" instead. By default, none of your SCSI devices are visible,
    so you need to enable those you need in the GUI. This change is both a safety
    measure and an attempt to be more consistent with other ports.
  - Some media access fixes.
  - Screen draw code rewritten.
  - Windows 98 specific screen code optimizations.
  - Windows 98 specific full screen mode optimizations.
  - "frameskip" changed to "framesleepticks". It's a value in milliseconds to
    "sleep" between screen updates. The higher the value, the lower the screen
    refresh rate. Experiment with values in range 3 .. 30.
  - Option to display the real frame rate.
  - Fixed a screen update problem; sometimes extra horizontal line segments were left behind
  - "cdenable.sys" driver updated. Under NT, update to \Winnt\System32\drivers.
  - Fixed: alt-F4 was always trapped by Basilisk II, even when targeted to other apps.
  - Now refuses to run if incompatible version of cdenable.* is detected.
  - Warns if cdenable.* is not found in correct folder.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 27.May.1999, build 63
  - Mouse should be more responsive now.
  - Fixed a problem: changes in parameter RAM were not saved if they were
    changed within the last minute before shutting down.
  - Thread priorities adjusted. 
  - Thread priorities can now be customized in the GUI.
  - Tip 1: those of you having problems with "winmodems" (modems with minimal
    hardware, AT command set emulated in software), try to adjust the 
    priorities. Bump the serial port up to the highest notch, and 
    possibly decrement CPU and/or graphics priorities. You may also try
    to adjust the 60Hz thread value.
    Tip 2: those of you running in windowed mode: if you move the Basilisk II 
    window around and you think other applications should update their windows 
    faster, reduce the CPU priority by one notch.
    Feel free to experiment with the settings; you can always revert back
    to the original settings by pressing the "Set Defaults" button.
    If you think you have found an optimal set of priorities (for some 
    specific purpose, or in general), drop me a line.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 25.May.1999, build 62
  - *Experimental* support for LPT ports, minimally tested.
    Please read what Christian has to say in "README" file about parallel ports.
    For your convenience, here's a snippet:

      Parallel ports: If you select a parallel port it will look like a serial
      port to MacOS but Basilisk II will only allow data output and ignore baud
      rate settings etc. You should be able to get some printers to work with
      this method (provided that you have the right printer driver, like
      "PowerPrint").

  - GUI: added LPT ports.
  - GUI: was not saving ntdx5hack value. Fixed.
  - GUI: when creating a new volume file, did not always prompt
         for confirmation if the file existed. Fixed.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 24.May.1999, build 61
  - Implemented GUI (BasiliskIIGUI.exe). No more need to edit the prefs file.
  - Keyboard code rewritten. If you are using some Mac app that maps
    charaters to different places, disable it first to see if you need
    it any more. Keyboard codes can be customized in GUI.
    (In prefs file, "keyboardfile BasiliskII_keyboard")
  - "nofpu" option was replaced by "fpu <true/false>", 
    default is "false" (disabled)
  - Two options on how to use right mouse button. Eiher drag the window,
    or send Control + Mouse click combination to MacOS.
    See the GUI (In prefs file "rightmouse <x>", x=0/1)
  - "frameskip" implemented, default is 1 (show all frames)
    There is a maximum of 33 frames per second. For example,
    "frameskip 3" yields to about 11 frames/second.
    Has no effect when using linear frame buffer mode, it always
    draws everything in real time.
  - Right mouse button double-click is not supported any more.
    Use the GUI instead.
  - Control-Shift-F11 now checks all removable media.
  - New video mode: Windowed Direct X mode "dxwin". 
    8 bits and 24 bits modes do not work right. Some screen update bugs.
  - Defining physical drives under Windows NT changed:
      disk \\.\PHYSICALDRIVEx
    where x = 0,1, ...
  - Fixed a Win9x bug: floppies were often mounted read-only.
  - Fixed various Win9x Zip problems (partition table handling)
  - Fixed a bug in closing serial port output semaphore.
  - Added "Null floppy" and "Null CD-ROM" items. Use these if you
    don't need floppies or CD's. Reduces some screen update jerkiness.
    If the floppy list or CD list is left empty, all floppies and
    cd drives in the system are included.


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 16.May.1999, build 54
  - Fixed a WinNT floppy problem
  - Fixed yet another WinNT CD bug
  - Implemented Win9x floppy (much slower than NT version)
  - Fixed a bug in win/x/y/b screen mode
  - Win9x keyboard: right-control maps to Option key
  - Win9x keyboard: Alt-F4 should work now
  - Win9x logical disk drives; "disk c:\". For your safety, all fixed disks
    are mounted read-only. Under MacOS 7.5.x, you will note that some 
    FAT folders look like system folders; this is a PC Exchange bug.
    Removable media (Zip etc) is mounted read/write.
  - If you cannot get IomegaWare working, you can mount Zip disks 
    with "disk j:\". If you do this, do not use IomegaWare
    at the same time!
  - If floppies or Zips mount read-only, you have some file open
    in Explorer or in some other application. Close them, you can also try:
      noscsi true 
    or
      disablescsi "IOMEGA" "ZIP 100"
  - Win9x CD: ISO & Joliet does not work yet (read TOC not implemented)


Win32 V0.5 (alpha) - 9.May.1999, build 49
  - option to set rom file name, command "rom <path>". default is "ROM"
  - option to enable/disable FPU, command "nofpu <true/false>", 
    default is "true" (disabled)
    Some ROM's may require that you set this to "false"
  - uae core streamlined (new vc5opti program). Some performance boost.
  - fixed a NT cdrom problem 
  - should work now with original Win95 (before OSR2)
  - prefs file name may be given as a command line parameter. 
    defaults is "BasiliskII_prefs".
  - experimental timer function removed, reverted back to a simple version.
  - "screen" command expanded to be similar as in other ports.
    Syntax is now: screen <mode>/<width>/<height>/<bits>
      <mode> is either "win", "dx" or "fb"
      <width> and <height> can be either zeroes (uses current screen values),
      or something else. "win" mode can use almost anything, for other modes
      there must be a corresponding DirectX mode.
      <bits> is ignored for mode "win" (uses current screen values)
      if the mode is "win" and the dimensions are different than the desktop
      dimensions, windowed mode is used. The window can be moved around by
      dragging with the right mouse button. This mode remembers window positions 
      separately for different dimensions
  - "greenish" 16bit mode screen problem: for "win" mode, should be fixed.
      For "dx" mode, change the <bits> field of the "screen" command,
      experiment with values 15 and 16. The default is 15 bits since it's
      considerably faster. Change to 16 if you need to.
  - Double-clicking with right mouse button opens a command menu:
      - About box
      - Create empty (non-formatted) HFV volume file
      - Check for floppy
      - Always on top
